    "The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effects of different diet types (Placebo, Keto, and Vegan) on weight loss in adults (male and female) aged 16 to 60. By using diet type as the main effect, we aim to discover how gender and age interact with it to influence weight loss outcomes. We will employ a factorial design to analyze the main effects and interactions, resulting in a total of 24 treatment combinations (3×4×2). This factorial structure allows us to specifically examine how weight loss may vary across different treatment groups. Data will be analyzed using statistical methods appropriate for factorial experiments, ensuring that all significant interactions are accurately interpreted."
